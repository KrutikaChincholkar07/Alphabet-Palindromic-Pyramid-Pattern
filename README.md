# Alphabet-Palindromic-Pyramid-Pattern
Alphabet Palindromic Pyramid Pattern (also called Alphabet Pyramid, Mirror Alphabet Pyramid, or Center-Aligned Alphabet Pattern)
Logic Explanation

For each row i:
Spaces decrease as rows increase.
Letters increase from A to the row letter (like A → B → C).
Then letters decrease back to A, forming a mirror (palindrome).
Use ASCII values:
